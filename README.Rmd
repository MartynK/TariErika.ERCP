# Before we begin
 
 - Do **not** use '_' in the project's name
 - Do **not** copy the .git folder to the project folder!
 - Do initialize your repo on GitHub
 - Do clone your repo onto a folder on your local machine
 - Do open a new 'devel' branch
 - Do copy the template stuff into the new folder now on said branch
 - Do update the 'PROJECTNAME' parts
 - Do some actual work (optional)

# PROJECTNAME

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/PROJECTNAME)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PROJECTNAME)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of PROJECTNAME is to ...
Have a home of my template for a new project.

As a reminder for myself, at each  version bump I need to update:

 - README.Rmd file (duh)  
 - devtools::build_readme() 
 - NEWS file (project name)  
 - DESCRIPTION (depends etc.)  
 - devtools::document() your project after defining new functions under /R  
 - devtools::build_site()
 - then devtools::install()  
 - only then devtools::check()  
 
Notes:

 - usethis::create_project() is a great resource  
 - usethis::create_tidy_package() is also great  

## Installation

You can install the development version of PROJECTNAME from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MartynK/MartysProjectTemplate")
```

You'd need to have R and RStudio installed on your computer for the full experience. The *.html* outputs are (usually) available in the *vignettes* and *docs* subfolders.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(PROJECTNAME)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
